Road Safety Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

Project Overview

This project analyses road accident data to derive actionable insights for improving road safety. The dashboard is built using Microsoft Power BI and covers multiple dimensions of accident analysis.


Dataset Explanation

The dataset includes:

- Accident index
- Accident date and day of week
- Junction control and details
- Accident severity
- Number of casualties and vehicles involved
- Road surface conditions
- Weather conditions
- Vehicle type

Each row represents a unique accident record with related attributes.


Approach and Process

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values by categorising them as "Unknown".
   - Ensured correct data types for dates and categorical columns.

2. Data Transformation:
   - Created measures for accident count, casualties, and severity distribution.

3. Visualisation:
   - Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers for weather and road conditions.
   - Used line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs for intuitive insights.

Key Insights

- Accident Severity Distribution: Most accidents were slight injuries, followed by serious and fatal.
- Top Junction Controls: Junctions with no control and give-way signs contributed to most accidents.
- Weather Conditions vs Severity: Majority of accidents occurred in fine weather, indicating driver behaviour as a primary cause.
- Casualties by Vehicle Type: Cars and bikes accounted for highest casualties.


Conclusion

This dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for targeted road safety interventions, focusing on high-risk junctions and vehicle types.

Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop for data cleaning, modelling, and visualisation
- GitHub for version control and project showcase
